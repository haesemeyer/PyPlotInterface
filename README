# PyPlotInterface
The goal of the PyPlotInterface class is to present an interface to a python process
for plotting via matplotlib.

The class creates and manages access to the python process via input and output redirection.
All plotting is done by creating variables in the python process (scalars and numpy arrays)
that represent the data handed to the C# interface. Rather than directly providing plot
function the interface of the class exposes function generators which return function objects
that perform the plotting itself. The reason for this is that it allows to first specify how
a plot should look like and subsequently create multiple instances of this formatted plot
without having to repass formatting parameters on each plot call.

Data transfer is currently limited to scalars and 1D numpy arrays (via structs in
InterConnect.cs). To transfer the data C# arrays are unfolded to list creation statement
which are then executed on the interpreter and passed to np.array(). While this works
reliably even for large arrays (>1e6 elements) it clearly isn't the most efficient approach.
Data passing will therefore likely be changed in the future.

REQUIRES:
PYTHON (www.python.org)
MATPLOTLIB (http://matplotlib.org/)
NUMPY (http://www.numpy.org/)
IPython and Jupyter_console (http://ipython.org/, https://jupyter.org/)
[Requirements can be easily satisfied by using a python package such as Anaconda]
